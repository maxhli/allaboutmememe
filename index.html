      He was a good student at schools. His GPA for the undergraduate degree is
      about 3.1. It is not high GPA, but getting good GPA in a Chinese
      university in 1980s is very difficult. His GPA for master's degree is
      about 3.66, but his GPA for his doctoral degree is about 3.92. He always
      told other people that he is not perfect. Why? Because for his doctoral
      studies, he got all As except one B+. He always remembers the professor
      who gave him a B+.
